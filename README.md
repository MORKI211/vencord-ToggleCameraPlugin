# ToggleCameraPlugin
A Vencord plugin that allows you to toggle your camera on and off using the `Ctrl + Shift + K` shortcut. Ideal for quick camera control without navigating Discord's interface.  

This is a great solution if you need this shortcut in **StreamDeck**, making it even easier to toggle your camera during streams or recordings!

> [!WARNING]  
> This plugin is designed for Vencord. Do not ask for support in the official Discord server if you encounter issues with installation.
